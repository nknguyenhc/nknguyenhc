Hi, I’m @nknguyenhc

I am currently pursuing Computer Science in NUS.

I previously interned at Decision Science Agency, and engineered Singlife's websites e-service forms.

I am working on MatchMiner, a platform for interest-sharing. The platform is set to be released within a few months.

Inspired by how technology can transform websites and enhance quality of life, I aspire to further pursue software development and artificial intelligence.
