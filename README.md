Hi, I’m @nknguyenhc

I am currently pursuing Computer Science in NUS.

I won gold medals in Mathematics and Physics Olympiad in high school. I aspire to apply my Mathematics skills in real-world problems, through Computer Science. In NUS Game Development Group, I have picked up game development skills and published a game within the first semester.

I am in the executive committee of NUS Game Development Group. The co-curricular activity empowers students with tools and knowledge to develop games.
