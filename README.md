Hi, I’m @nknguyenhc

I am currently pursuing Computer Science in NUS.

I participated in Mathematics and Physics Olympiad in high school. I aspire to apply my Mathematics skills in real-world problems, through Computer Science.

In my free time I also develop my hobbies, which include acoustic guitar, harmonica and chinese chess.
